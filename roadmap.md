So far the idea is that each instance of RGS runs seperately. How exactly this will be done is still a question, though Docker might be a good solution. AWS, Heroku, and a custom solution are also posibilities.

I think this project needs a new name.

A landing page/marketing will need to be done at some point, but now is not the time.

I WILL wireframe this project before jumping right in
