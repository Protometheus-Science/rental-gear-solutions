So far the idea is that each instance of RGS runs seperately. How exactly this will be done is still a question, though Docker might be a good solution. AWS, Heroku, and a custom solution are also posibilities.

I think this project needs a new name.

A landing page/marketing will need to be done at some point, but now is not the time.

I WILL wireframe this project before jumping right in (view previous project at <https://gist.github.com/jacksarick/7917426b8e26ab3d21238e0b919ad110>)

Wireframe notes:

- [x] Switch "Select" from checkbox to some sort of count so you can check out multiple of one item
- [ ] Get all buttons working
- [ ] Design a "modal" system of some sort
- [ ] Eventually connect the wireframe to the backend

I understand the wireframe shouldn't work, but I want to try something new. Design the backend first, then redecorate the front end.
